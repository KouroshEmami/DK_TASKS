Please keep in mind that as I said in my interview, I am not familiar with machine learning. So, I had to do some research about the genetic algorithms and watch some YouTube videos.

## initialize_population
This function seems to be only population one item in its list. Usually there is a series of 0s and 1s in each list.
To fix this, I introduced a variable called `individual_length`, it is set to 10 by default but can be modified when calling the function. Then I added a loop for populating each individual up to the `individual_length`.

## selection
This function is working as intended and I was not able to find any issues with it.
But it does call the `calculate_fitness` function as its key for sorting the population which has a bug and can be further optimized.

## calculate_fitness
This function is mistakenly increasing the fitness score by the value `i` for each time the item in cell `i` is equal to `1`. This should change from `i` to `1` as, in general, the place in the list should not matter in the fitness.

## crossover
The loop introduced in the second line of the function would raise an `IndexError: list index out of range` error. I fixed this by checking the conditions of creating the `parent2` and skipping it if would go out of bounds.
This function has a hard-coded cutoff value of 4 for the crossover. Because I changed the code so that the `individual_length` can be modified, it would make sense for the cutoff point to be calculated dynamically which is what I did, it now takes half of the `individual_length`  as its value.

## mutation
In the fourth line of this function, `random.rand` was used which is a method for Numpy library. It was mistakenly called so I changed it to `random.random`.
I also wrapped the value of its conditional in an integer type casting to avoid any issues when printing the population.
One optimization that could be done is to make the value flip from a 0 to 1 and from a 1 to 0 when the conditions for the if statement is met.

## main
I added the variable `population_size` to more easily initialize the population with the desired size and to avoid hardcoding as I have made some changes to the logic.
I added an if statement to check if the length of offspring is equal to the population so that we do not end up with an empty list in a few generations. if the length of offspring is less, it would randomly add some of the selected individuals in addition to the offspring as part of the next generation population.

## main guard
There's a typo with calling the main function. I removed the `s`.

        else:
            continue
